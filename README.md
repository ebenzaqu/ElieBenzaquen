# DataStructuresProjectSpring2020
Data Structures course project (Spring 2020) - Developed an application that takes                                                        
document files and stores them in memory. Built in dictionary look up that maps to all
documents containing that word.Users can determine how many documents they 
want to store in memory and when the limit is reached, the document is stored on 
disk in JSON format.System tracks the most recently used documents to determine 
which to serialize. Able to undo any operation in the application.
